A list of papers / resources online that have helped me. Mostly about AI / Graphics / Math / Audio.

Learning Resources 
- [LearnCpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) - Amazing resource to learn c++ from scratch. Great for the experienced programmer or new programmer.
- [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) - Describes how to build basic rendering engine from scratch with theory. 

Practice Resources
- [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) - online C/C++/etc. compiler. 
- [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) - Great site to practice with fragment shaders (if I didn't want to use my own engine).

Cpp Resources
- [Blog on Build Systems](https://julienjorge.medium.com/an-overview-of-build-systems-mostly-for-c-projects-ac9931494444) - good overview on build systems to compile code to vs2022, xcode, gnu make (premake vs cmake vs ninja vs meson)

Graphics / AI Papers
- [Paper Collection](https://kesen.realtimerendering.com/) - List of papers submitted at SIGGRAPH, but very easily accessible]
- [Variable Bitrate Neural Fields](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/vqad/) - use neural fields to compress geometry
- [Terrain Synthesis from DEGs](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/my_papers/terrain_synth_tvcg.pdf) - Use Elevation Models to create terrain that follows a user's sketch
- [StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) - Change traditional GAN architecture to include intermediate latent space. Also style mixing.

Videos
- [Stable Diffusion by Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CIpzeNxIhU) - Simple but in depth explanation of stable diffusion
- [Stable Diffusion coding by Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lz30by8-sU) - More in depth look of the code of stable diffusion
- [Multiplayer in Minecraft Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAUdIQZKV88) - First look at programming multiplayer in cpp
- [The Continuity of Splines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds&t=3975s) - Video essay looking at Splines. Very in depth and informative.
- [The Art of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmS-F6RJhAk) - Youtube channel for fragment shading.
