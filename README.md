A list of papers / resources online that have helped me. Mostly about AI / Graphics / Math / Audio.

Learning Resources 
- [LearnCpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) - Amazing resource to learn c++ from scratch. Great for the experienced programmer or new programmer.
- [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) - Describes how to build basic rendering engine from scratch with theory. 
- [Technical Writing](https://css-tricks.com/technical-writing-for-developers/) - Quick blogpost on technical writing 
- [Tu Wain Rendering / RayTracing Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLujxSBD-JXgnGmsn7gEyN28P1DnRZG7qi) - Entire course from Tu Wain on RayTracing in cpp
- [3D rotations blog](https://thenumb.at/Exponential-Rotations/) - Blog post describing different methods of rotation

Practice Resources
- [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) - online C/C++/etc. compiler. 
- [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) - Great site to practice with fragment shaders (if I didn't want to use my own engine).

Cpp Resources
- [Blog on Build Systems](https://julienjorge.medium.com/an-overview-of-build-systems-mostly-for-c-projects-ac9931494444) - good overview on build systems to compile code to vs2022, xcode, gnu make (premake vs cmake vs ninja vs meson)

Graphics / AI Papers
- [Paper Collection](https://kesen.realtimerendering.com/) - List of papers submitted at SIGGRAPH, but very easily accessible]
- [Variable Bitrate Neural Fields](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/vqad/) - use neural fields to compress geometry
- [Terrain Synthesis from DEGs](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/my_papers/terrain_synth_tvcg.pdf) - Use Elevation Models to create terrain that follows a user's sketch
- [StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) - Change traditional GAN architecture to include intermediate latent space. Also style mixing.

Textbooks
- [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](https://www.pbr-book.org/) - Book on Physically Based Rendering, simply meaning the rendering is based on how light behaves in the real world. This book describes how you can use pbr concepts when implementing a ray tracer.
- [Game Engine Architecture (3rd edition)](https://www.gameenginebook.com/) - Fundamental book in game engine architecture
- [Ray Tracing in a weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) - Great concise resource that builds a simple ray tracer without an API

Videos
- [Stable Diffusion by Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CIpzeNxIhU) - Simple but in depth explanation of stable diffusion
- [Stable Diffusion coding by Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lz30by8-sU) - More in depth look of the code of stable diffusion
- [Multiplayer in Minecraft Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAUdIQZKV88) - First look at programming multiplayer in cpp
- [The Continuity of Splines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds&t=3975s) - Video essay looking at Splines. Very in depth and informative.
- [The Art of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmS-F6RJhAk) - Youtube channel for fragment shading.
