A list of papers / resources online that have helped me. Mostly about AI / Graphics / Math / Audio.

Learning Resources 
- [LearnCpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) - Amazing resource to learn c++ from scratch. Great for the experienced programmer or new programmer.
- [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) - Describes how to build basic rendering engine from scratch with theory. 

Practice Resources
- [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) - online C/C++/etc. compiler. 

Graphics / AI Papers
- [Paper Collection](https://kesen.realtimerendering.com/) - List of papers submitted at SIGGRAPH, but very easily accessible]
- [Variable Bitrate Neural Fields](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/vqad/) - use neural fields to compress geometry
- [Terrain Synthesis from DEGs](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/my_papers/terrain_synth_tvcg.pdf) - Use Elevation Models to create terrain that follows a user's sketch
- [StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) - Change traditional GAN architecture to include intermediate latent space. Also style mixing.
