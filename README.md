A list of papers / resources online that have helped me. Mostly about AI / Graphics / Math / Audio.

Learning Resources 
- [LearnCpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) - Amazing resource to learn c++ from scratch. Great for the experienced programmer or new programmer.
- [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) - Describes how to build basic rendering engine from scratch with theory. 
- [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) - Resource on slowly learning more and more complicated fragment shaders.
- [Tu Wain Rendering / RayTracing Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLujxSBD-JXgnGmsn7gEyN28P1DnRZG7qi) - Entire course from Tu Wain on RayTracing in cpp
- [Scratchapixel](https://scratchapixel.com/) - Education site that progressively introduces you to the world of computer graphics

Learning Blogs
- [Technical Writing](https://css-tricks.com/technical-writing-for-developers/) - Quick blogpost on technical writing 
- [3D rotations blog](https://thenumb.at/Exponential-Rotations/) - Blog post describing different methods of rotation

Practice Resources
- [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) - online C/C++/etc. compiler. 
- [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) - Great site to practice with fragment shaders (if I didn't want to use my own engine).
- [RGB -> HSV demo](https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/demos/c2/rgb-hsv.html) - Tool to build intuition behind HSV colorspace

Cpp Resources
- [Blog on Build Systems](https://julienjorge.medium.com/an-overview-of-build-systems-mostly-for-c-projects-ac9931494444) - good overview on build systems to compile code to vs2022, xcode, gnu make (premake vs cmake vs ninja vs meson)
- [Unreal Engine 5 Docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Camera/UCameraComponent/) - The documentation for unreal engine 5.

Graphics / AI Papers
- [Paper Collection](https://kesen.realtimerendering.com/) - List of papers submitted at SIGGRAPH, but very easily accessible]
- [Variable Bitrate Neural Fields](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/vqad/) - use neural fields to compress geometry
- [Terrain Synthesis from DEGs](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/my_papers/terrain_synth_tvcg.pdf) - Use Elevation Models to create terrain that follows a user's sketch
- [StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) - Change traditional GAN architecture to include intermediate latent space. Also style mixing.
- [Prompt-to-Prompt Image Editing with Cross Attention Contro](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01626) - Change weights of words / add words / replace words in a prompt to edit generative images
- [Neural Codec Language Models are Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizers (VALL-E)](https://valle-demo.github.io/) - Leverage Codec Intermediate space and lots of data to create very good TTS. Can replicate someone's voice or emotion with 3 seconds of input

Transformers / Self Attention Based Methods
- [Blog on transformers](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers) - very good blog with code on transformers.
- [Transformer Neural Networks Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQQlZhbC5ps) - Great teaching style and short form video on transformers

Textbooks
- [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](https://www.pbr-book.org/) - Book on Physically Based Rendering, simply meaning the rendering is based on how light behaves in the real world. This book describes how you can use pbr concepts when implementing a ray tracer.
- [Game Engine Architecture (3rd edition)](https://www.gameenginebook.com/) - Fundamental book in game engine architecture
- [Ray Tracing in a weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) - Great concise resource that builds a simple ray tracer without an API
- [Real-Time Rendering](https://www.realtimerendering.com/) - Book on real-time rendering techniques 
- [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-computer/9781482229417/) - This textbook is a good resource for the fundamentals of computer graphics. More helpful if one has not had an introductory class on Computer Graphics.
